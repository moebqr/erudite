## Overview
Erudite is an open-source AI powered Chatbot and Search Engine. Erudite takes deep dives into the internet, indexes vector stores, and uses a plethora of tools to deliver the best results and responses.

### The Tech Behind it
- **LangChain**: For General LLM calls, and is the core for all LLM interactions and function calling & retrieval.
- **LangGraph**: To Create Production-Ready AI Agents with access to many tools (Web search, RAG, Conversational, etc.).
- **LangServe**: For the deployment of our LangChain App as a Production-Ready API.
- **LangSmith**: Tracing, monitoring, and debugging our LLM app.
- **Chainlit**: Chatbot Frontend UI, integrations into discord and more. (Might switch to a custom React App in the future)
- **OAuth**: Authorization
- **AWS**: IN THE FUTURE - Deployment of entire app for secure self hosting.
